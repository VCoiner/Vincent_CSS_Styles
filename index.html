Hi fellow internet goer I am vincent Coiner and this is a website about my life. With a not very Creative title "My Life". A little bit about me is that I am 16 and currently a Junior in highschool. Also I attend Damien Highschool in La Verne California. Here is a picture of my school: </div>

<div class="column left">
Above is the school quad which is the center of our school. It is usually occupied by Damien Highschool Seniors. The quad is one of their many senior privlages and is only accesible to them during school hours. Although after the final school bell rings and the flag is taken down anyone can walk into the quad.
